## The Script family

In all frankness, these programming languages are not necessarily related. But for namesake, I briefly summarise them below.

- [JavaScript](#javascript)
- [TypeScript](#typescript)
- [ActionScript](#actionscript)
- [CoffeeScript](#coffeescript)
- [PureScript](#purescript)
- [ReScript](#rescript)
- [GolfScript](#golfscript)

## JavaScript

Quite likely one of the most prevalent programming language. Ubiquitous in frontend and web development. From the era of JQuery, to Ember.js and Angular, to Vue and React. Its influence grows ever larger since node.js delivers it from the constraint of browser. Nowadays it can be used for server and other areas. Do note that JavaScript, as a programming language, is unrelated to Java. Although both do share similar syntax.

## TypeScript

A superset of JavaScript. With typing, readonly and optional fields, interface, generic, enum and many other featreus, Typescript is usually the better choice for medium and large projects. When combined with ESLint and modern editor, the time saved by TypeScript likely outweighs the time typing. Most importantly, its features are optional and can be opt-out by type "any". It should be noted that, however, typing is a developer-only feature that does not enforce during runtime because eventually TypeScript compiles to JavaScript.

## ActionScript

A programming language for creating Adobe Flash content. Back in 2000-2010 Adobe Flash was synonym for web game, animation and personally I think was a major driving force of popularising programming, creative content and web culture. Its popularity waned in around 2013 as mobile apps eclipsed web games. ActionScript is hardly relevant now. Adobe Flash was discontinued in 2020. But for many programmers, animators, creactive content creaters, it will always have a special place.

## CoffeeScript

Influenced by OCaml, CoffeeScript is a programming language that compiles to JavaScript. It enhances some aspects of JavaScript so it is more expressive and less verbose. However, JavaScript has evolved a lot since its inception and many features of CoffeeScript is achievable in native JavaScript. Nowadays, it is questionable if the additional overhead and lower compatibility of frameworks is worthwhile for the benefit. And when compared to TypeScript, it is even more debatable.

## PureScript

Inspired by Haskell, PureScript is a programming language with theme of functional programming that compiles to JavaScript. It provides an interesting alternative to JavaScript. Unlike CoffeeScript, it does not have a strong focus on improving JavaScript.

## ReScript

A relatively new Script language. Its implication and usage is too soon to be summarised.

## GolfScript

A programming language specifically created for code golf. Code golfing means to implement an algorithm with the shortest source code, usually judged by total characters.

### ECMAScript

ECMAScript is better thought of as a standard for scripting languages, including JavaScript. Similar to ISO in other domains, ECMAScript standardises scripting languages. Imagine there is no standard for JSON, the whole internet would collapse immediately.

### NativeScript

NativeScript is a framework for creating mobile app that can run on both iOS and Android. It is not a programming language. Similar framework includes React Native.
